# Flipper Zero Firmware Documentation

Welcome to the Flipper Zero Firmware Developer Documentation!

This documentation is intended for developers who want to modify the firmware of the Flipper Zero. If you are looking for the user manual, please visit [the User Documentation](https://docs.flipperzero.one/).

The documentation is divided into several sections, with all of them accessible from the sidebar on the left. Aside from the manually-written documentation files, there's also a few automatically-generated ones at the bottom of the list, and also in the header of each page:

* [Data Structures](annotated.html)
* [Files](files.html)

They are generated from the source code, and are useful for quickly finding the source code or API documentation for a particular function or data structure.
